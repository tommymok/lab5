this hugeint is using array ,class to make it,put all numbers in different places,make sure each array places got one number,so we can store all the numbers
to add the number or sub the numbers,it also do it inside the array,whan both number add is more that 10,than put one to the next places (進位).
same as add,when the number is not enough to sub the other number take 1 from the the back and add it to 10 ,let the number can sub it
thats the progame how it works
